# Exploratory Data Analysis: Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020  

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020 dataset. The survey provides insights into the demographics, work preferences, tools, and technologies used by developers worldwide. This analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights from the dataset.

## **Project Overview**  

The Stack Overflow Developer Survey is one of the largest surveys of developers globally. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to better understand the programming community, its diversity, and the tools & technologies shaping the field.

This project involves:  
- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.  
- Analyzing developer demographics and diversity.  
- Exploring trends in programming languages, tools, and frameworks.  
- Understanding work patterns, education, and career trajectories.  
- Visualizing insights to make the analysis intuitive and engaging.

## **Inferences and Conclusions**  

We've drawn many inferences from the survey. Here's a summary of a few of them:  

- **Demographics**:  
  The survey is somewhat representative of the programming community. However, it underrepresents programmers from non-English-speaking countries and women & non-binary genders.  

- **Diversity**:  
  The programming community is not as diverse as it can be. While improvements are underway, more efforts are needed to support underrepresented communities in terms of age, country, race, gender, and more.  

- **Education**:  
  While most programmers hold a college degree, a significant percentage did not major in computer science. This suggests that a computer science degree is not mandatory to build a programming career.  

- **Employment**:  
  A considerable percentage of developers work part-time or as freelancers, which is often an excellent entry point for newcomers in the field.  

- **Programming Languages**:  
  - Javascript & HTML/CSS were the most used languages in 2020, followed by SQL and Python.  
  - Python is the most desired language to learn due to its versatility and ease of use.  
  - Rust and TypeScript are the most "loved" languages, with Python a close third.  

- **Work Patterns**:  
  Developers worldwide work around 40 hours per week on average, with slight variations by country.  

- **Age & Career**:  
  Learning programming and starting a career at any age is possible. A fulfilling career awaits those who also enjoy programming as a hobby.
